General

Venturing into big data via various data structures and algorithms for analysis, organization and querying of large genomic datasets using C++, Slurm and a compute cluster.

- [Array Constructs](https://github.com/Anirban166/Big-Data-ft.-LSDS/tree/main/Programs/Array%20of%20Arrays): Using an array of arrays to store, sort and search through 50-character sequence fragments from a dataset in FASTA format with over 36 million reads.
- [Linked List Constructs](https://github.com/Anirban166/Big-Data-ft.-LSDS/tree/main/Programs/Linked%20List%20of%20Arrays): Using an unidirectional singly linked list of character arrays to store and search through sequence fragments, with these in turn being used as queries against 50-mer sequences of the Bacillus anthracis genome, with over 36 million and 5.2 million entries in the read set and genome file respectively.

Data
--- 
Sample datasets to test my code against can be found [here](https://github.com/Anirban166/Big-Data-ft.-LSDS/tree/main/Sample%20Data). Files that exceed a hundred megabytes have been brought under the bar with a small subset of the original data being extracted, as the full versions for those go upto several gigabytes of data, and would need paid use of GitHub's large file system.
